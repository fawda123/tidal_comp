This repository contains materials for comparing generalized additive models (GAMs) and the recent adapation of Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) for tidal waters.  Please see the [WRTDStidal](https://github.com/fawda123/wtreg_for_estuaries) page for an R package to implement WRTDS in tidal waters.
